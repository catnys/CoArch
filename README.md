# Computer Architecture Course üñ•Ô∏è

Welcome to the **Computer Architecture** course offered by Princeton University (AKA CoArch :)). This README provides a comprehensive overview of the course content, structure, and key topics.

***

## Course Overview

This is an **advanced-level** course designed for students with a foundational knowledge of computer organization. It delves into the principles of modern microprocessor design, covering the fundamental concepts that govern how today's computers work. The course is taught by **Professor David Wentzlaff** of the Princeton University Electrical Engineering department.

## Topics Covered ‚úçÔ∏è

The curriculum is divided into **21 modules**, covering a wide array of topics essential to understanding computer architecture. The course is highly theoretical and focuses on a deep understanding of concepts rather than practical implementation.

### Core Concepts

* **Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**: How instructions are defined and executed.
* **Pipelining**: A technique to improve instruction throughput. 
* **Hazards**: Issues that can arise in pipelined processors.
* **Microcode**: A layer of code that translates machine instructions into a sequence of operations.

### Memory Systems

* **Cache Memory**: Understanding different levels of cache and their importance in performance.
* **Advanced Caching Techniques**: Exploring techniques like prefetching and victim caches.
* **Memory Management**: How memory is organized and protected.

### Advanced Processor Design

* **Superscalar Processors**: Processors that can execute multiple instructions in a single clock cycle.
* **Out-of-Order Execution**: A technique to improve performance by reordering instructions.
* **Branch Prediction**: Methods used by processors to guess the outcome of a branch.

### Parallelism and Multiprocessors

* **Vector Processors and GPUs**: Specialized architectures for parallel computation.
* **Multithreading**: Executing multiple threads concurrently on a single processor.
* **Multiprocessor Systems**: Architectures with multiple CPUs.
* **Cache Coherence Protocols**: Protocols to maintain data consistency in multiprocessor systems.
